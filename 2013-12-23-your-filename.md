It’s great to see more and more people embracing this healthy, cruelty-free lifestyle. After 6 months of complete vegan diet, I’ve never felt so energetic, happy and beautiful. You will soon realize it was the best decision of your life, too! However, I can totally relate to the confusion and hardship that most new vegans experience in the beginning of the transition. You don’t know what to eat, you fear that you may deprive your body of nutrients, and worst of all – you won’t be able to get out and socialize! But you don’t have to worry anymore – as you go through your daily life, you will find it easier to cope with any obstacle gets in your vegan way.

## Motivation

Think about your decision. Make a list with all the reasons why you’ve chosen this, and call it every time you lose your motivation or temptation is around the corner. This is a satisfactory will power exercise! I assure you – after a couple of weeks, that piece of meat won’t impress you anymore. And if it does, you don’t have to feel bad about it. Transition doesn’t happen overnight, and there’s no such thing as failing. Have confidence, and your body appetite will start listening to you. Afford yourself time, and ask for help anytime you need – there’s an entire vegan community supporting you!

## Finding your way through the non-vegan community

Parents and friends may not be as helping as the vegan community. I know, I know, but hey, you don’t have to please everybody. If people are curious, explain them briefly why you’ve made this choice, but don’t try to convince them. Be open and understanding, and realize that at some point of your life, you had the same perceptions as them. Focus on the open-minded people in your life, and you will attract people that share the same alimentary preferences with you. When I first turned vegan, I didn’t know anybody to talk about this with, but internet is our best friend after all, isn’t it?

If you live with non-vegan people, create your own shelves with vegan products. Find time to cook or share vegan meals with them, and who knows, maybe they will like it. Be the power of example! When you go out to eat, check for places with vegan products or call at restaurants to ask about and pre-order specific meals. If someone invites you to a party with ordered food, politely ask them if they can offer you some alternatives.  A lot of restaurants are putting out vegan meals in their menu to satisfy as many clients as possible, but if not, just ask the waiter to bring you a meal without a specific ingredient.  They will do anything to please the client!

## What to eat?

After the mind-set, it is time for a fridge and larder content change! Go to the grocery store and buy your favorite fruits, veggies and seeds. Eating them raw is a great lazy way to start.

I realize that following recipes found on the internet is challenging, and most of them require exotic ingredients. But you don’t have to do exactly what they say – be creative and experiment! Boil the vegetables you find in your house with some spices and something delicious can come out. Remember the foods your mum was preparing during fasting periods: maybe it was bean soup, potato stew or rice. After a while, vegan cooking will come in handy to you.

Make sure that you intake enough calories. In the beginning, the body may experience some discomfort as detoxification effects, but that’s not a sign you should go back to previous eating habits. Your body will soon adapt. Further check the internet for food nutritional value, and chose foods in order to satisfy your body with the nutrients you need. Understand that you can do that with only vegan products.
